What is pushu.ps
=======

Pushu.ps is a simple tracking app for your daily pushups workout. It's main purpose was to give me a look on how to build Svelte websites and learn the new thing. The app and the design itself are copyrighted but the source is open for learning purposes.


Development
=======
To install the app locally you would need Node.js, npm  and possibly git. Then you need to clone the repository:

	git clone https://github.com/z-x/pushu.ps.git

Next, navigate to the local repository that you've just downloaded

    cd x:/pushu.ps

And finally install the whole thing to get all the dependencies:

	npm install

Run the development server
-----------
To run the dev server you just need to run

	npm run dev

It should run the server at http://localhost:5000 by default so you can just type this into your browser navigation bar and you should see the app.

The code includes comments for easier understanding if you are looking for any particular solution. I am aware it could be better in places, but please keep in mind that this is a after hours project. ;)

The code and the design files are opened only for learning purposes, please keep in mind that the final app is copyrighted.
